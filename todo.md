# Current
* On rated-entries, a section of the most frequently used tags for that rating

# Important
1. On tagged-entries, a section of the average rating for that tag
1. updatedAt, createdAt timestamps using the actual time/date a la Reddit/BigMood
1. Tracking productivity day-by-day
  - Clickable points where you can click to the entry
    - Or even a small pop-up
      - RATING: 5
      - *tag1*, *tag2*, *tag3*
1. Auth a la Reddit
1. Navbar a la Reddit
1. Deleting an entry should delete its tags from the allTags array

# Time permitting
1. Change auth to OAuth or passport
1. Better styling - DIV CLASS (a la Reddit) on forms

# Would be MAJOR CHANGES so ONLY do if time REALLY permits
1. Edit comments
1. Switch from handlebars to something else (maybe. *maybemaybemaybemaybe*)
