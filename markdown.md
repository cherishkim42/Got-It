# ‚ù§Ô∏è Current

### Left off here
* On rated-entries, a section of the most frequently used tags for that rating
  * Test the function I put in ```rated-entries.handlebars```
  * Once tested - put it somewhere else maybe? Like make something called ```helpers.js```???
  * Incorporate the now-tested stuff into the actual ```rated-entries.handlebars``` page!!!

### Backlog
1. On tagged-entries, a section of the average rating for that tag
1. updatedAt, createdAt timestamps using the actual time/date a la Reddit/BigMood
1. Tracking productivity day-by-day - clickable points where you can click to the entry (or get a small pop-up) and see RATING & TAGS (**omg data visualization??** üò±)
1. Auth a la Reddit
1. Navbar a la Reddit
1. Deleting an entry should delete its tags from the allTags array

### Time permitting
1. Change auth to OAuth or passport
1. Better styling - DIV CLASS (a la Reddit) on forms

### Would be MAJOR CHANGES so ONLY do if time REALLY permits
1. Edit comments
1. Switch from handlebars to something else (maybe. *maybemaybemaybemaybe*)

# üì∫ Old Stuff - not using

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1374126/how-to-extend-an-existing-javascript-array-with-another-array-without-creating/17368101#17368101
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17035297/getting-schema-attributes-from-mongoose-model
* At some point I said "try unshift, not push"
* Not using this lol:
```
      function helpMe (thingToAdd) {
        var allTags = []
        var count = []
        var i = 0
        for (tag in thingToAdd) {
          if (tag in count) {
            count[allTags[tag]] = count[allTags[tag]] + 1
          } else {
            allTags.extend(tag)
            count.extend(1)
          }
        }
        for (tag in allTags) {
          dict.extend((allTags[i], count[i]))
          i = i + 1
        }
        return dict
      }
```
